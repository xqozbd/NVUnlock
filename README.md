To make your README look like a command terminal output while incorporating the content you've shared, we can use Markdown with proper formatting to simulate a terminal session. Here's an example:
```
C:\Users\Void> echo Uhhhh stupid shit happening by retard and Void
Uhhhh stupid shit happening by retard and Void

C:\Users\Void> echo Welcome to Skibidi Rizz Ohio by Void
# Skibidi Rizz Ohio - Void

C:\Users\xqozbd> echo remind me to blow my brains out
# remind me to blow my brains out -xqozbd

C:\Users\Void> _ 
```
